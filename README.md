# Network Traffic Forecast

**Objective**: Predict the network traffic load for different times of day or different days of the week.
**Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow/Keras (for LSTM models), Pandas, Jupyter Notebook.
**Steps**:

- Analyze historical network traffic data.
- Preprocess the data into a time-series format.
- Implement an LSTM model, a popular model for time series predictions.
- Validate the model against a test set and visualize the results.
